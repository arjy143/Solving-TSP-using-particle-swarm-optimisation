# Solving-TSP-using-particle-swarm-optimisation

This project implements Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) to solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The implementation explores multiple PSO variants and compares their performance across different datasets.

The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimisation problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each node exactly once and returns to the starting point. This project explores how Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a nature-inspired optimisation technique, can be applied to solve TSP efficiently.

We implement two PSO variants:
Velocity-based swap mutations
Genetic-inspired segment reinsertion

These approaches are benchmarked against datasets from TSPLIB.

The key dependencies include:
numpy
matplotlib
requests
pandas
